JPad is a small utility program developed on 21/05/2014 due to the
(weird) popular demand by some group members. The application is no
doubt not fit for standard or personal use, it was just meant to
describe how simple developing GUI applications can be. It has just
few basic features which are saving and opening file, copy/cut/paste,
and search/replace(added on 11/06/2014).
